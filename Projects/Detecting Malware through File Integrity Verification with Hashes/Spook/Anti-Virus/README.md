There are 5 Folders.

1. Archive was for the Code we were previously working on, but it is outdated now.

2. Backline has codes that do not work properly.

3. Back-Up is just for the backup folder.

4. FrontEnd contains the FrontEnd codes (Not Responsive).

5. Streamline contains the working features of the Code.
